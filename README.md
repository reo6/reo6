<h2>projects</h2>

_There's always a story behind my every little project._

- [_dotfiles_](https://github.com/ramazanemreosmanoglu/dotfiles): It's time to rearrange everything so I won't need to set everything up again when I distrohop.

- [_rdmachine_](https://github.com/ramazanemreosmanoglu/rdmachine): _Still working on this._ An experimental drum machine project.

- [_haskellutions_](https://github.com/ramazanemreosmanoglu/haskellutions): Beginner level Haskell solutions. Couldn't find something real to do with haskell but I love it.

- [_drumkit_](https://github.com/ramazanemreosmanoglu/drumkit): Just a toy thing, I don't have much to tell about this, I don't even know why does this exist.

- [_steering wheel_](https://github.com/ramazanemreosmanoglu/steering-wheel): Another maker project. Creating virtual steering wheels, breaking 1$ cheap rotary encoder and a mouse, having fun with my father.
